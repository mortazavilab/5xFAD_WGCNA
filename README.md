## Systematic Phenotyping and Characterization of the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease 

Mouse models of human diseases are invaluable tools for studying pathogenic mechanisms and testing interventions and therapeutics. For disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease in which numerous models are being generated, a challenging first step is to identify the most appropriate model and age to effectively evaluate new therapeutic approaches. Here we conducted a detailed phenotypic characterization of the 5xFAD model on a congenic C57BL/6J strain background, across its lifespan – including a seldomly analyzed 18-month old time point to provide temporally correlated phenotyping of this model and a template for characterization of new models of LOAD as they are generated. This comprehensive analysis included quantification of plaque burden, Abiochemical levels, and neuropathology, neurophysiological measurements and behavioral and cognitive assessments, and evaluation of microglia, astrocytes, and neurons.  Analysis of transcriptional changes was conducted using bulk-tissue generated RNA-seq data from microdissected cortices and hippocampi as a function of aging, which can be explored at the MODEL-AD Explorer and AD Knowledge Portal. This deep-phenotyping pipeline identified novel aspects of age-related pathology in the 5xFAD model.


### WGCNA analysis 

A gene expresion matrix filtered by genes with more than 1 TPM and without an outlier sample (both cortex and hippocampus from that sample were removed) was used to do a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA).
